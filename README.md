# My time at the University of Houston
For those who knew who I was, and knew what I did at UH, you know why now, why years after I graduated, why even now considering my distaste for the engineering college there, that I am taking the time out of my life to update this page. For those who don't, I encourage you to read

that I will be sure to link back to here.

This repository contains all of the Engineering Education work I did at the Univeristy of Houston through the Cullen College of Engineering, the M.D. Anderson Library, the Robotics Club at the University of Houston, and many other. 

# File Overview
This repository is organized into 4 sections.

| /MakerspaceatUH | Lecture Slides from University Drone Pilots and Robotics@UH that I recorded. | powerpoints, lecture links, code|
| /RoboticsatUH | Presentations I gave to Robotics@UH to train students for the future of Robotics  | Powerpoints  |
| /ESIDEatCullen | Lectures I gave at the besest of the Engineering College to try and improve it | powerpoints, lecture links, code|
| /Classwork | Notes from my classwork | code, video links |
| /PagesandBlog | Functional blog items to maintain the blog and wiki | just blog code  |

I leave this to all students at UH to try and solve problems in the future, and hopefully change the Engineering College where others can. Thank you to Dr. Burleson, Dr. Roysam, many other professors who chose not to be named, Robert Dial, Ralph Brown, and CMDR Sablin.
