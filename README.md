# About 

## My time at the University of Houston
For those who knew who I was, and knew what I did at UH, you know why now, why years after I graduated, why even now considering my distaste for the engineering college there, that I am taking the time out of my life to update this page. For those who don't, I encourage you to read
[why](/pages/why). I leave this to all students at UH to try and solve problems in the future, and hopefully change the Engineering College where others could not. Thank you to Dr. Burleson, Dr. Roysam, Robert Dial, Ralph Brown, and many other professors who chose not to be named. 

> Special thanks to CMDR V. Sablin, who shouted at me to finally get this repo reorganized. It is [through his rage](https://www.change.org/p/give-uh-students-a-place-to-learn-practical-skills) that inspired me to create a page with resources for makers across Houston.

## Author Bio
Bernard Li started in 2017 as an undergraduate student at the University of Houston. 6 years later, in 2023, later than anyone wanted, he graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in Mathematics, a failed second minor in National Security that he is still angry about not finishing, and a lot more you can find out about in the [about me page](./pages/about_author).

## Use Information
