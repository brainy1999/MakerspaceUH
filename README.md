# My time at the University of Houston
For those who knew who I was, and knew what I did at UH, you know why now, why years after I graduated, why even now considering my distaste for the engineering college there, that I am taking the time out of my life to update this page. For those who don't, I encourage you to read
[why](./pages/why).

> This repository contains all of the Engineering Education work I did at the Univeristy of Houston through the Cullen College of Engineering, the M.D. Anderson Library, the Robotics Club at the University of Houston, and many other. 

# File Overview
This repository is organized into 4 sections.

1. /[MakerspaceatUH](MakerspaceatUH/makerspace_page.md) - Lecture Slides from University Drone Pilots and Robotics@UH that I recorded. 
2. /[RoboticsatUH](./pages/why) - Presentations I gave to Robotics@UH to train students for the future of Robotics education. 
3. /[ESIDEatCullen](./pages/why) - Lectures I gave at the besest of the Engineering College to improve the student ability.
4. /[Classwork](./pages/why) - Notes from my classwork.
5. /[Pages](./pages/why) - Functional blog items to maintain the blog and wiki.

I leave this to all students at UH to try and solve problems in the future, and hopefully change the Engineering College where others can. Thank you to Dr. Burleson, Dr. Roysam, many other professors who chose not to be named, Robert Dial, Ralph Brown, and CMDR Sablin.

# About
Bernard Li started in 2017 as an undergraduate student at the University of Houston. 6 years later, in 2023, later than anyone wanted, he graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in Mathematics, a failed second minor in National Security that he is still angry about not finishing, and a lot more you can find out about in the [about me page](./pages/about_author).
