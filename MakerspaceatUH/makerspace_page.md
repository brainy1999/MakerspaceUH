# Makerspace at UH Libraries
The Makerspace@UH Libraries was a vision by Dr. Baydri Roysam, now former chair of Electrical Engineering, and Dean Lisa German, former dean of Libraries. It envisioned a future of libraries which focused on a library's true goal, as a place of learning. The idea took fruit in 2017, and in 2018 with the help of many, the Makerspace began teaching it's first workshops.
