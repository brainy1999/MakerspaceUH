# Makerspace at UH Libraries
The Makerspace@UH Libraries was a vision by Dr. Baydri Roysam, now former chair of Electrical Engineering, and Dean Lisa German, former dean of Libraries. It envisioned a future of libraries which focused on a library's true goal, as a place of learning. The idea took fruit in 2017, and in 2018 with the help of many, the Makerspace began teaching it's first workshops. In 2022, with a policy and dean change at the UH Library, Makerspace@UH libraries, which had plan to expand to other branches, was shut down to refocus the library on other matters.

# Workshops
These workshops are intended for a general audience, someone with little to no programming/software experience.

## Arduino
Arduino is an open source, easy to learn embedded device. It forms the backbone of students being able to develop easy methods to write code that can measure, monitor, and affect the real world.
